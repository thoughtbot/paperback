# Paperback

Standardize and streamline ebook production.

Paperback makes it easy to generate ebooks in many formats (pdf, html, epub and
mobi) from Markdown files.

It combines [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html) with some
custom Markdown extensions which make it easy to pull in code samples from a
bundled example application.
